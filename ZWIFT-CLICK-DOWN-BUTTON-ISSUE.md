# ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT DISCOVERY: Your Zwift Click DOWN Button Issue

## The Problem
Your Zwift Click is sending **IDENTICAL DATA** for both buttons:
- UP button: `37 08 00 10 01` âœ…
- DOWN button: `37 08 00 10 01` âœ… (but not being detected)

## Possible Causes:

### 1. **Hardware Issue**
- The DOWN button might be physically broken
- Try pressing it harder or from different angles
- Check if it "clicks" properly

### 2. **Your Zwift Click Model**
Some Zwift Click models use:
- **Single press** = UP
- **Double press** = DOWN
OR
- **Short press** = UP  
- **Long press** = DOWN

Try these:
1. **Double-click** the button quickly
2. **Hold** the button for 2 seconds
3. Press **both buttons** at once (if there are two physical buttons)

### 3. **Firmware Issue**
Your Click might need a firmware update through the Zwift app

## IMMEDIATE FIX for Your App

Since we can't detect the DOWN button properly, here's a workaround:

```javascript
handleZwiftClickData(dataValue) {
    const data = new Uint8Array(dataValue.buffer);
    
    if (data[0] === 0x37 && data.length >= 5) {
        const stateByte = data[2];
        
        if (stateByte === 0x00) {
            const currentTime = Date.now();
            
            // Debounce
            if (currentTime - this.buttonState.lastMessageTime < 200) return;
            this.buttonState.lastMessageTime = currentTime;
            
            // WORKAROUND: Alternate between UP and DOWN
            // This ensures both functions work even with one button
            if (this.buttonState.lastButtonPressed !== 'down') {
                this.handleDownButton();
                this.buttonState.lastButtonPressed = 'down';
            } else {
                this.handleUpButton();
                this.buttonState.lastButtonPressed = 'up';
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## How This Works:
- **First press**: DOWN (Lap in Manual, -5% in Auto)
- **Second press**: UP (Zone in Manual, +5% in Auto)
- **Third press**: DOWN again
- etc...

## To Test Your Hardware:
1. Open the Zwift app on your phone
2. Connect your Click
3. See if both buttons work there
4. If not, your DOWN button is broken

## Alternative Control Methods:
You could also add keyboard shortcuts as backup:
- Arrow UP = Zone up / +5%
- Arrow DOWN = Lap / -5%
- Space = Toggle Auto mode

Would you like me to:
1. Add the alternating button fix to your app?
2. Add keyboard shortcuts as backup?
3. Create a version that uses double-click for DOWN?
