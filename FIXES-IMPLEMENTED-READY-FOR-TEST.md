   🎯 Ready to receive power, speed, and cadence data!
   ```

5. **Start pedaling** - you should see:
   ```
   📊 Indoor Bike Data: 0x02 0x44 0x1a 0x00 0x64 0x00...
   ⚡ Power: 150W
   🚴 Speed: 25.3 km/h
   🔄 Cadence: 85 RPM
   ```

6. **Check the UI** - Power, Speed, Cadence should update in real-time!

### **Step 2: Test Zwift Click Resistance System**
1. **Click "🎮 Pair Real Click"**
2. **Select your Zwift Click**
3. **Press + button on device** - should see:
   ```
   🎮 Button data: 0x01 0x02 0x00
   🎮 + Button: Gear 1 (0% resistance)  
   🚴 Applied 0% resistance to Kickr
   ```

4. **Check displays update:**
   - Main gear number: **1** 
   - Resistance percentage: **0%**
   - Current resistance metric: **0%**
   - Kickr resistance slider moves to 0%

5. **Keep pressing +** to cycle through all levels 0→1→2→3→4→5→6→7→0

6. **Press - button** for lap counting

## 🔧 **What to Look For:**

### **If Kickr Data Still Not Working:**
- ✅ **Check the service discovery log** - shows exactly what services are found
- ✅ **Look for data messages** - shows raw hex data being received  
- ✅ **Check characteristic types** - confirms which data formats are available
- ✅ **Verify parsing attempts** - shows which parsing methods are being tried

### **If Zwift Click Display Still Not Updating:**
- ✅ **Check button data messages** in log
- ✅ **Verify resistance % shows in multiple places**
- ✅ **Confirm Kickr slider moves when + pressed**

## 🎯 **Key Improvements:**

1. **📊 Comprehensive Data Parsing**: Handles all BLE fitness data formats
2. **🔍 Full Service Discovery**: Maps entire BLE service structure  
3. **🎮 Complete UI Updates**: All resistance displays update properly
4. **📡 Real-time Debugging**: See exactly what data is received
5. **🔧 Smart Fallback**: Multiple parsing methods for compatibility

## 💪 **Why This Should Work:**

1. **✅ Service Discovery**: Automatically finds all available services instead of guessing
2. **✅ Multi-Format Parsing**: Handles Indoor Bike Data, Power Service, Speed/Cadence Service
3. **✅ Real-time Monitoring**: Sets up notifications on ALL available characteristics
4. **✅ Smart Detection**: Uses data patterns and known ranges to identify power/speed/cadence
5. **✅ Comprehensive Logging**: Shows exactly what's happening for debugging

## 📱 **Files Updated:**

1. **`js/enhanced-kickr-handler.js`** - Complete Kickr handler with service discovery
2. **`js/simple-zwift-click.js`** - Updated UI functions for resistance display
3. **`index.html`** - Updated button handlers to use enhanced functions

## 🏆 **Expected Results:**
